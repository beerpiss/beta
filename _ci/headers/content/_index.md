# App List
{{< notice warning >}}
Unless specified otherwise, if there are multiple bypasses listed, use <strong>one</strong> of them at a time.
{{< /notice >}}

> Some apps (such as ones developed by Niantic and Nintendo) are updated frequently to patch their jailbreak detection. Some bypasses may need updates and or workarounds for these apps to function. With that said, please note that discrepancies may exist between the status of bypasses across jailbreaks. In our testing, Substitute/Substrate based jailbreaks worked more often.
